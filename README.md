# Crashy (aka Procrastibot 2.0)

An overly-complicated nostalgic remake of a very simple robot from my past,
bringing together a Sphero 2.0 and and ESP32-CAM to fumble around smooth
surfaces, sharing pictures of everything it hits.

## Hardware

 * Sphero 2.0 (and "Chariot" accessory)
 * DFRobot ESP32-CAM Development Board (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1879.html)

## TODO

 * Crash detection. Should only take photo if crashes. Needs configuration of
   async packets from Sphero to use.
